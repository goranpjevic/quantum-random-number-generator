                        quantum-random-number-generator

generate random numbers using simulated quantum circuits.

note:

the first line of the output are all the generated values.  the following lines
are a table where the first column contains all the unique values sorted in an
ascending order by size and the second one the amount of times the value
generated.

usage:

  equal distribution of all possible values using hadamard gates:

    h [number_of_qubits] [number_of_iterations]

  equal distribution of all possible values using rotation gates:

    r [number_of_qubits] [number_of_iterations]

  set the probability of getting a result:

    f [number_of_qubits] [number_of_iterations] [expected_probability] [expected_result]
